## How to Use

### MenuBar
- You can use the menu bar to quit the engine, activate or deactivate the different windows, access to the Engine's different GitHub spaces and load Primitives into the scene.

### Windows

#### Configuration:
- You can use Configuration to change the settings of the different modules of the Engine, check out some of their information and toy with the different rendering and
  window options.
- You can also use it to save the texture being used as a .ket (Kore Engine Texture)

#### Console:
- Any relevant message to your use of the Engine will show up in the console. Watch out for errors!

#### About:
- Displays information about the Engine.

#### Hierarchy:
- You can use the Hierarchy window to select the different game objects in the scene in order to see their components in the Inspector Window. 
  To select any object, click on the checkbox before its name. The scene starts with no objects selected and each time you select an object the rest of them are deselected.

#### Inspector:
- In the Inspector window you can see all the components of a game object and their properties, delete them or interact with them.

### Controls

#### General:
- ESC --> Quit

#### Scene Camera:
- Right Click --> Free Lookaround
- Right Click + WASD --> Free camera movement in the x and y axis
- Mouse Wheel --> Zoom in/out
- Alt + Left Click --> Orbit around the object
- Shift --> Duplicate movement speed of any of the before mentioned controls
- F --> Focus the camera around the object

#### Drag & Drop:
- You can drag and drop any .FBX, .fbx, .dds or .png file into the scene in order to import 3D models and textures. It may happen that there isn't any feedback
  from the program, if the console doesn't show any errors, try again, probably the input wasn't detected. 
- Before dropping a texture, you should have selected a game object. If not, the console will return an error and the texture won't be importer!


## Additional Comments

- Lenna and the Pink Baker_House texture are since we thought they could be useful to try stuff around, for example with the primitives.

- We hope you enjoy our delivery! :)
